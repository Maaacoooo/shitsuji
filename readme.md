Mighty butler is here to serve you! Shitsuji is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) based Anime Downloader.

# Note - 1.2 is no longer working #

I've been heavily depending on rawranime.tv for this project, since rawranime.tv is no longer alive, this project might as well end... I'll try to find more source so we can keep this going.

##Requirements##
* PHP 7 or higher
* Terminal or Command Prompt
* php_curl extension

##Basic Usage##
* run ```php shitsuji.phar```
* type the desired anime you want to download
* you can also select quality by typing ```quality:[quality]```
* example: ```quality:720p``` will download video with 720p quality
* you can also select language preference by typing ```language:[language]```
* example ```language:raw``` will download the raw version of anime if available
* typing ```console:exit``` will quit the cli

##Features##
* interactive CLI
* Anime episode as index
* Batch Anime Downloading
* Custom Episode Selections example (1-5 - to download 1 to 5), (1,5 - download only 1 and 5)
* File checking (skip downloading file if it exists) [pending]

##Future Features##
